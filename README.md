SYLLABUS : <br />
• Pulse Circuits: Bistable, Astable and monostable MVs and Schmitt Triggers using transistors, OP Amps and 555 timers. <br />
• TTL and CMOS Gates: Study the characteristics of  TTL and CMOS gates. <br />
• Combinational logic circuits: Design and implementation of combinational circuits such as, ALU, 7-segment LED display driver, etc. <br />
• Sequential Circuits: Design of sequence genera-tors and detectors, counters, Design of ASMs such as, traffic light controllers, lift controllers, etc. <br />
